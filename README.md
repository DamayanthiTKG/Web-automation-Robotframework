Web Automation using Robot framework with Python


Introduction
Robot Framework Â® is a generic open source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain text syntax and it can be extended easily with generic and custom libraries.
Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It is implemented using Python which is also the primary language to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects. For more information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, see http://robotframework.org.
Robot Framework project is hosted on GitHub where you can find source code, an issue tracker, and some further documentation. Downloads are hosted on PyPI.
Robot Framework development is sponsored by Robot Framework Foundation. If you are using the framework and benefiting from it, consider joining the foundation to help maintaining the framework and developing it further.

For more detailed installation instructions, including installing Python, see INSTALL.rst.

Robot Framework requires Python 3.6 or newer and runs also on PyPy. If you need to use Python 2, Jython or IronPython, you can use Robot Framework 4.1.3.

Example
Below is a simple example test case for testing login to some system. You can find more examples with links to related demo projects from http://robotframework.org.

Usage

Tests (or tasks) are executed from the command line using the robot command or by executing the robot module directly like python -m robot .

The basic usage is giving a path to a test (or task) file or directory as an argument with possible command line options before the path:

robot tests.robot
robot --variable BROWSER:Firefox --outputdir results path/to/tests/
Additionally, there is the rebot tool for combining results and otherwise post-processing outputs:

rebot --name Example output1.xml output2.xml
Run robot --help and rebot --help for more information about the command line usage. For a complete reference manual see Robot Framework User Guide.
